    Hass-blocks is all about creating blocks that describe what you want to
    happen and combining them with triggers to make an automation. There are a
    few different kinds of blocks
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Actions</strong> - a generic block that describes something you <em
        >want to happen</em
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Service Calls</strong> - an action that calls a Home Assistant service
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Assertions</strong> - a block that decides whether a sequence of actions
      should continue executing
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sequences</strong> - a block that when executed executs a number of
      different blocks, either in sequence or all at once
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Conditions</strong> - a block that decides which block to execute based
      on a condition
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Since this is a framework, its your job to write a whole bunch of blocks
    that you can then compose together in order to build your automations, so
    lets talk a little bit about how to do that.

        very early stages. Watch this spaceâ€¦</strong
